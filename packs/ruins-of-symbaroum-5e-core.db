Choosing \"Spellcasting\" as the Corruption ability will use whatever ability is set on the actor's \"Spellbook\" tab.</li>\n<li>For spellcasting NPCs, they are assumed to be full casters if their spellcaster level (found on the \"Spellbook\" tab) is non-zero and then follow the same rules governing Corruption ability as described for full caster characters.</li>\n<li>Any actor's Corruption Threshold can be overridden and a custom threshold used instead by selecting \"Custom\" from the Corruption ability dropdown and filling in the Threshold input field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"pblock\">Additionally, the system will automatically manage the increase in Temporary or Permanent Corruption generated from casting spells, while considering the effects of favoured and upcasted spells. When a spell is rolled and its chat card created in the chat log, the very end of the chat card will contain both the corruption expression rolled (ex. '1d4 + 1') as well as its resulting value, which is applied to a character's Temporary Corruption and an NPC's Permanent Corruption, unless overridden. <br /><br />While using a Symbaroum 5e sheet, the actor's spell slot data will be entirely ignored and suppressed from display on the sheet. Maximum spell level is computed dynamically following the Symbaroum 5e class progression tables. While using the core dnd5e sheet, the actor's corruption data and relevant mechanics will be entirely ignored and suppressed from display.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Items and Corruption</h2>\n<p class=\"pblock\">In addition to spells, all Symbaroum 5e items (defined as either owned by a Symbaroum 5e actor OR residing in the sidebar) have the ability to not only generate, but use any generated corruption expressions as part of its rollData. <br /><br />To define a custom corruption expression for an item, or to modify the corruption generated from a spell, enter your desired changes in the three input fields labeled \"Corruption\", added just below \"Resource Consumption\" on the item's details tab. These three fields represent \"corruption type\", \"change mode\", and \"value\" respectively. Populating either the type or mode dropdown will modify any corruption generated by default from the item. Note, non-spells generate 0 corruption by default. The operation of these fields are described below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Corruption type: Either default (empty), Temporary, or Permanent. Will redirect any generated corruption to that particular corruption pool. Note, NPCs generate Permanent Corruption by default and characters generation Temporary Corruption by default.</li>\n<li>Change mode: Either none (default), ADD, MULTIPLY, or OVERRIDE. Only spells have the ADD and MULTIPLY change modes and will add to or multiply the default spell corruption calculation. The default value, displayed as an empty string causes the third field (value) to be ignored. Finally, OVERRIDE will replace the item's default corruption expression entirely with the provided expression in that third field, which can address the item's rollData via the \"@\" syntax, including \"@item.level\", which can be used to create custom corruption scaling expressions for spells and spell-like abilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"pblock\">Additionally, when an item generates corruption, both the die expression used to generate the final value and the final value itself is stored an accessible via the item's rollData, which can then be utilized in damage formulas. For example, a special smite class ability may generate 1d4 + @mod Temporary Corruption and then deal three times that amount as damage. The custom corruption expression would read as \"Temporary | OVERRIDE | 1d4 + @mod\" and the damage formula would read \"@item.corruption.total 3\" which results in damage equal to three times the corruption this actor took by activating the feature. The new rollData fields are listed below and remain static until the item is rolled again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@item.corruption.expression - Die expression that generated the most recent corruption value.</li>\n<li>@item.corruption.total - Number representing the total amount of corruption evaluated from the corruption expression.</li>\n<li>@item.corruption.summary - Human readable string detailing both the expression and result of the most recent corruption expression.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">Rest Types</h2>\n<p class=\"pblock\">The core dnd5e resting types have been modified and extended to support this ruleset's three-tierd rests -- Short, Long, and Extended -- with similar rest dialogue. The primary change is the ability for characters, on some rest types, to spend hit die in order to reduce Temporary Corruption. When this option is available for a rest, a few new elements are added to the resting dialog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[Roll] Corruption - expends a hit die and reduces your current Temporary Corruption by an amount described in the dialog's informational text.</li>\n<li>Results Upon Completion - details the final values of the actor's HP and Corruption once the \"Rest\" button is pressed. Players can use this information to quickly decide if more healing or corruption reduction is needed before the rest's free healing is applied. Note, the Corruption information is presented as \"Temporary (Total) / Threshold\" for quick reference.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">Other New Actor And Item Functionality</h2>\n<p class=\"pblock\"> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>New weapon and armor proficiencies have been added for the new equipment introduced.</li>\n<li>Actors have received a new special trait named \"Soulless\", which implements the corruption-to-health mechanic presented by such features as the Dwarf's \"Earth Bound\" trait.</li>\n<li>Spell items can be marked with their favoured status, which is taken into account during spellcasting corruption calculations.</li>\n<li>The \"deep impact\" weapon property will be automatically considered when rolling a weapon's critical damage.</li>\n<li>Weapons using ammunition without an attack roll (ex. Firetubes) will correctly add its ammo's damage formula to its own. However, like attack based ammunition, the ammo's damage type is ignored -- it is suggested to use die tags (ex. `1d10[thunder]`) in these situations.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">GM/Player Configuration Options</h2>\n<p class=\"pblock\">Under <strong>\"Configuration Settings &gt; Module Settings &gt; Symbaroum 5E Ruins of Symbaroum - Core System\"</strong> you will find the <strong>\"Configure Symbaroum 5E Settings\"</strong> button. <br />Here you can change the PC and NPC sheet backgrounds to predefined images, selected colors or the Text to your chosen color or change one or both sheets to the default dnd5e colors (This will be the default colours and fonts).</p>\n<br /><br />\n<div class=\"imagecontainer\"><img style=\"width:80%;margin-bottom:0%\" src=\"modules/symbaroum5ecore/images/journal/settings-panel.webp\" /></div>\n<br /><br />\n<div class=\"imagecontainer\"><img style=\"width:80%;margin-bottom:0%\" src=\"modules/symbaroum5ecore/images/journal/settings-dropdown.webp\" /></div>\n<br /><br />\n<div class=\"imagecontainer\"><img style=\"width:80%;margin-bottom:0%\" src=\"modules/symbaroum5ecore/images/journal/settings-color-picker.webp\" /></div>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"arpgtable\" style=\"background-color:transparent;width:90%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"width:90%\">\n<td class=\"tdstyle3D\" colspan=\"3\">\n<h2>OPEN GAME LICENSE</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"width:90%\">\n<td class=\"tdstyle3D\" colspan=\"3\">\n<h3>OPEN GAME LICENSE Version 1.0a</h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"width:90%\">\n<td class=\"tdstyle3D\" colspan=\"3\">\n<p class=\"pblock\">The following text is the property of Wizards of the Coast, Inc. and is Copyright 2000 Wizards of the Coast, Inc (“Wizards”).
